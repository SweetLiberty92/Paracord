A decentralized, self-hostable, open-source Discord alternative.

## The Why

On February 9th, 2026. Discord's CEO announced that they would be starting to roll out age verification in the coming month. This meant that all accounts would be labeled as "teen" and one would have to prove they were an adult through an AI powered face scan or uploading government issued ID. The privacy implications of this should be incredibly obvious, and at least my group of friends that regularly used Discord were 100% against giving Discord any of this information, and frankly, didn't feel they should have to. But Discord doesn't have any magic that makes them untouchable in the software space, so here we are, a completely decentralized Discord alternative, gotten up and running in under a week from their announcement. Many new features will be coming to Paracord at breakneck speed, and it already includes many of Nitro's big features like high resolution streaming, just without the paywall :). 

## Features

- **Text Chat** - Guilds, channels, DMs, reactions, file sharing, typing indicators
- **Voice & Video** - WebRTC via bundled LiveKit SFU, mute/deafen, push-to-talk
- **Live Streaming** - Screen share up to 4K/60fps with quality presets
- **Roles & Permissions** - Granular permission bitfields, channel overwrites
- **Friends System** - Add friends, block users, pending requests
- **Customization** - Themes (dark/light/amoled), custom CSS injection
- **Self-Hosted** - Single executable, SQLite database, zero external dependencies

| Download | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `paracord-server-windows-x64-*.zip` | Server with LiveKit bundled. Extract and run! |
| `Paracord-Setup-*.exe` | Desktop client installer for Windows |

## Quick Start

### Hosting a Server

1. Download and extract the server zip
2. Run `paracord-server.exe`
3. Config and database are auto-created on first run
4. Share the public URL printed in the console with friends

That's it. UPnP auto-forwards ports on most home routers. If your router doesn't support UPnP, forward TCP port 8080 and TCP/UDP 7880-7892.

### Joining a Server

1. Install the Paracord client
2. Enter the server URL (e.g., `73.45.123.99:8080`)
3. Create an account and start chatting!

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Server | Rust (axum, tokio, SQLx) |
| Client | Tauri v2 + React 19 + TypeScript |
| Database | SQLite (embedded, zero-config) |
| Voice/Video | LiveKit SFU (bundled) |
| State | Zustand v5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |

## Development

### Prerequisites
- [Rust 1.91+](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)

### Running Locally

```bash
# Clone and enter project
git clone <repo-url>
cd paracord

# Build and run client dev server (in one terminal)
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

# Run server without embedded UI (in another terminal)
# Vite dev server proxies API/WS requests to the server
cargo run --bin paracord-server --no-default-features
```

### Building for Release

```bash
# Build client web UI
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Build server with embedded web UI
cargo build --release --bin paracord-server

# The server binary now includes the web UI - no --web-dir needed
./target/release/paracord-server
```

### Configuration

The server auto-generates `config/paracord.toml` on first run with:
- Random JWT secret (64-char hex)
- Random LiveKit API credentials
- SQLite database in `./data/`
- UPnP enabled by default

All settings can be overridden via environment variables prefixed with `PARACORD_`.
